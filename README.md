# About Me:
I’m a Platform and Cloud DevOps Engineer who enjoys building reliable cloud systems and making complex infrastructure easy to use.

Most of my work lives around AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I design and operate scalable platforms using ECS, EKS, GitOps, and CI/CD pipelines. I focus on clean infrastructure design, automation, security, and developer experience.

I’ve worked on multi region architectures, shared Terraform modules, production grade CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms that teams can deploy on with confidence. I care about clarity, documentation, and building things that last.

I like solving real problems, learning how systems behave under load, and turning messy setups into simple, repeatable patterns.


## Things I enjoy working on

I enjoy building cloud platforms that teams actually enjoy using. My day to day work spans AWS infrastructure, Kubernetes and ECS based platforms, Terraform driven infrastructure as code, and CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins. I’m a strong believer in GitOps with ArgoCD and care deeply about observability, reliability, and scaling systems the right way.

## Currently learning 
I’m currently going deeper into platform engineering, Kubernetes internals and networking, cloud security, and cost optimization. I’m also actively preparing for the CKA certification and sharpening my Kubernetes application design skills.

Ask me about
AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD design, GitOps, scaling applications, and DevOps troubleshooting.
