## Hi there, I'm Sanjay Khambam!👋

# About Me:
I’m a Platform and Cloud DevOps Engineer who enjoys building reliable cloud systems and making complex infrastructure easy to use.

Most of my work lives around AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I design and operate scalable platforms using ECS, EKS, GitOps, and CI/CD pipelines. I focus on clean infrastructure design, automation, security, and developer experience.

I’ve worked on multi region architectures, shared Terraform modules, production grade CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms that teams can deploy on with confidence. I care about clarity, documentation, and building things that last.

I like solving real problems, learning how systems behave under load, and turning messy setups into simple, repeatable patterns.

<br>Things I enjoy working on -
	•	AWS infrastructure and cloud architecture
	•	Kubernetes, ECS, and container platforms
	•	Terraform modules and infrastructure as code
	•	CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins
	•	GitOps with ArgoCD
	•	Observability, reliability, and scaling systems <br>

<br>Currently learning - 
	•	Platform engineering patterns
	•	Kubernetes internals and networking
	•	Cloud security and cost optimization
	•	Improving developer experience on internal platforms<br>

Ask me about
AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD design, GitOps, scaling applications, and DevOps troubleshooting.
<br><br>⚡ Fun fact<br>I enjoy breaking complex systems into simple building blocks and documenting them so others can move faster with confidence.
